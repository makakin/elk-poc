This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.\r\n\r\nThe logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).\r\n\r\nThe New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.\r\n\r\nThe network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.\r\n\r\nThe authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.\r\n\t- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.\r\n\t- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.\r\n\t- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.\r\n\t- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","Category":"Logon","Opcode":"Info","SubjectUserSid":"S-1-0-0","SubjectUserName":"-","SubjectDomainName":"-","SubjectLogonId":"0x0","TargetUserSid":"S-1-5-18","TargetUserName":"DC01$","TargetDomainName":"SEC555","TargetLogonId":"0xd51a41","LogonType":"3","LogonProcessName":"Kerberos","AuthenticationPackageName":"Kerberos","LogonGuid":"{F2745349-6DDC-9FD6-ACEB-A0F80B1630E4}","TransmittedServices":"-","LmPackageName":"-","KeyLength":"0","ProcessName":"-","IpAddress":"::1","IpPort":"59676","ImpersonationLevel":"%%1833","EventReceivedTime":1496947235,"SourceModuleName":"eventlog","SourceModuleType":"im_msvistalog","@version":"1","@timestamp":"2017-06-08T18:40:35.389Z","host":"10.5.55.2","port":59656,"type":"windows","tags":["json"]}

Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.\r\n\r\nThe authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.\r\n\t- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.\r\n\t- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.\r\n\t- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.\r\n\t- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","Category":"Logon","Opcode":"Info","SubjectUserSid":"S-1-0-0","SubjectUserName":"-","SubjectDomainName":"-","SubjectLogonId":"0x0","TargetUserSid":"S-1-5-18","TargetUserName":"DC02$","TargetDomainName":"SEC555.COM","TargetLogonId":"0xfc3347","LogonType":"3","LogonProcessName":"Kerberos","AuthenticationPackageName":"Kerberos","LogonGuid":"{9E94A890-7645-7345-B7F6-C5CE450B57BC}","TransmittedServices":"-","LmPackageName":"-","KeyLength":"0","ProcessName":"-","IpAddress":"::1","IpPort":"62131","ImpersonationLevel":"%%1840","RestrictedAdminMode":"-","TargetOutboundUserName":"-","TargetOutboundDomainName":"-","VirtualAccount":"%%1843","TargetLinkedLogonId":"0x0","ElevatedToken":"%%1842","EventReceivedTime":1496947403,"SourceModuleName":"eventlog","SourceModuleType":"im_msvistalog","@version":"1","@timestamp":"2017-06-08T18:43:23.660Z","host":"10.5.55.3","port":62092,"type":"windows","tags":["json"]}
